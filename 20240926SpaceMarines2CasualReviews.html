                <h3>Warhammer 40k: Space Marines 2 Casual's Review</h3>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-09-26">September 26, 2024</time></p><br>
                <p>Today, I’m giving a Casual’s review of Space Marine 2 by Sabre Interactive.
                    As someone with almost no experience in the Warhammer 40k universe, I feel like this game will be the entry point
                    for a lot of people. Why? Why, this of all games? Have you seen this game?
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/contentImages/Warhammer%2040,000_%20Space%20Marine%202_20240922191623.jpg" alt="Full-scale War" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <br>
                    My initial reaction was, "This looks too good to be true." Honestly, I expected it to be cancelled or fade into the aether, but 
                    it arrived—exactly as promised.
                    I bought it for the base PlayStation 5 and played on Performance Mode. With a price tag of €70, the question is—was it worth it?<br><br>
                    My first run was a co-op playthrough with @nopurposeindie. The game lets you team up with two other players to tackle 
                    the campaign or the multiplayer-focused mode, Operations. I'm not much into PvP, so I’ll leave those insights to the cut-throats.
                    However, Operations mode exceeded my expectations. It feels like a separate campaign but is actually a supplement to the 
                    main storyline.<br><br>
                    The main character interacts with other squads on the barge or via comms, but in Operations, you are those
                    other squads. It reminded me of Mass Effect 3’s multiplayer, where you feel as though you had an impact on the overall 
                    narrative through your involvement in the multiplayer.<br><br>
                    Thankfully, the game offers bots in Operations, so if you can’t find other players, you’re not left stranded. 
                    I always appreciated future proofing for modes like these when they inevitably go offline. The only downside is that you 
                    can’t control who joins your game unless you start with a premade team or play offline.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/contentImages/Warhammer%2040,000_%20Space%20Marine%202_20240923210655.jpg" alt="Fallen Bell" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <br>
                    When it comes to presentation, Space Marine 2 absolutely excels. Scale and intensity are its biggest strengths. 
                    The characters are massive, heavy, and move with a sense of purpose. Citizens in the game constantly bow to the Space Marines, 
                    revering them as if they were deities come to bring salvation in their most dire moment.<br><br>
                    Similarly, The Emperor’s name is invoked by everyone, from high-ranking officials to ordinary people. This not only sells the scale of the universe but also 
                    adds gravitas to the story. As someone unfamiliar with the lore, I’m deeply curious to learn more about this Emperor, the Space 
                    Marines, the Chaplins…. my wallet may be in danger here.<br><br>
                    Their dialogue projects pride, reverence, and duty, layers masking their humanity until it shines through when the need arises 
                    resulting in some very satisfying character moments. This isn’t easy to pull off—it would’ve been all too simple to reduce these 
                    characters to "hoo-rah" meatheads. But the story wisely keeps its stakes high and its characters focused on what should be an 
                    impossible task.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/contentImages/Warhammer%2040,000_%20Space%20Marine%202_20240924164516.jpg" alt="Chaplin addressing Space Marines" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <br>
                    The voice cast does an incredible job bringing these characters to life. Backed by an intense, often oppressive soundtrack 
                    and intricate environmental design, the game draws you in—right until the disconnections start. Sadly, they happen frequently.
                    Most issues occurred on the battle barge, which serves as your hub between missions. We could get through the missions 
                    with only a few disconnections, but moving between them on the barge? We were booted three or four times just moving from 
                    mission end to mission start.<br><br>
                    Thanks to previews, we knew about these problems going in and were prepared to tough it out. 
                    Still, it put a damper on the co-op experience, as we couldn’t just hang out and explore the barge at our own pace.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/contentImages/Warhammer%2040,000_%20Space%20Marine%202_20240922192311.jpg" alt="Frontline Warfare" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <br>
                    As far as gameplay is concerned, I loved every second of it, especially the focus on melee combat and health/armour management. 
                    Like Doom (2016) and Outriders (2021), Space Marine 2 rewards aggressive playstyles. Enemies swarm you, tearing through your 
                    health and armour, and the only way to recover is by executing stunned foes or firing follow-up shots. The game’s parryable and 
                    dodgeable attacks add to the intensity, creating heroic moments—whether you’re dodging at the last second or countering their 
                    attempts at flanking.<br><br>
                    The only negatives I have is that the weapon variety is pretty minimal. Feels like we are swapping firing modes more so than 
                    swapping weapons. Additionally I would have liked more options earlier. I was disappointed to discover that I couldn’t equip 
                    the shield at any point in the campaign.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="images/contentImages/Warhammer%2040,000_%20Space%20Marine%202_20240923193031.jpg" alt="A meeting that could've been a vox" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <br>
                    There are so many standout cinematic moments and intense character interactions, but they’re best experienced firsthand.<br><br>
                    In the end, I’d recommend this game to anyone—whether you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or, like me, taking your 
                    first steps into the Warhammer 40k universe. However, if you are a multiplayer enthusiast you might need to wait a few 
                    patches for the best experience, otherwise this is a must-play.<br><br></p>
