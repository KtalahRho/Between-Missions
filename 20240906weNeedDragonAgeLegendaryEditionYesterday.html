                <h3>We need a Dragon Age: Legendary Edition yesterday!</h3>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-07-30">September 06, 2024</time></p><br>
                <p>Never has a Dragon Age: Legendary Edition been more necessary.
                    Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition could do with some love, especially on console but Dragon Age: Origins needs urgent care on PC.</p><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>DA: Origins has a memory leak issue on PC.</li>
                    <li>DA: Origins and DA: 2 can't even be played on modern PlayStations.</li>
                    <li>DA: Inquisition is still stuck at 30fps on PlayStation</li>
                    <li>DA: Origins and DA:2 lack controller support on PC.</li>
                    <li>DA: Origins and DA:2 lack the tactical camera/mode on console.</li>
                    <li>Dragon Age Keep exists only on a browser.</li>
                    <li>All three games lack keyboard and mouse support on console.</li></ul><br>
                    
                    <p>It's a lot of wishful thinking on my part but a Legendary Edition with the features of both the PC and console versions, even if they were locked to whether you're using a controller or mouse and keyboard,
                    would absolutely be worth buying them all over again. A built-in version of Dragon Age Keep is essential. So much of DA: Inquisition's content will be lost if it goes offline.<br><br>
                    The Xbox versions are all backward-compatible and have the 60fps boost; however, Xbox does not have ultimate versions of DA: Origins or DA:2,
                    and since the DLC almost never goes on sale... Xbox is the best place to play, but the worst place to pay.<br><br>
                    The hope is that if DA: Veilguard does well, EA will see the value in preserving and uplifting the series so far.</p>
